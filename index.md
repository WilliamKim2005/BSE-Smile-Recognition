# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servoâ€™s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint. 

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was finding a database from Sklearn called the "Olivetti faces dataset". From there made a user interface so I could classify the 400 images in the dataset as either smiling or not smiling. I finished classifying the 400 faces.

My first milestone was setting up my Rasberry Pi. I was able to connect the power supply, monitor, and camera to my Pi. I was also able to install the OS onto my Pi using a micro sd card and a chip reader. Also, I found a data set I can use for my machine learning program.
