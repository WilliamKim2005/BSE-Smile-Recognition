# Final Milestone
For my final milestone, after I finished the tedious process of classifying the 400 faces, I then used a image to test if my model was working.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was finding a database from Sklearn called the "Olivetti faces dataset". From there made a user interface so I could classify the 400 images in the dataset as either smiling or not smiling.

My first milestone was setting up my Rasberry Pi. I was able to connect the power supply, monitor, and camera to my Pi. I was also able to install the OS onto my Pi using a micro sd card and a chip reader. Also, I found a data set I can use for my machine learning program.
