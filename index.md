# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servoâ€™s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was setting up my Rasberry Pi. I was able to connect the power supply, monitor, and camera to my Pi. I was also able to install the OS onto my Pi using a micro sd card and a chip reader. Also, I found a data set I can use for my machine learning program.
